# String Date Parser

## Belfast Functional Programming

_A very quick kata at
[Belfast FP on Wednesday 30 October 2019](https://www.meetup.com/BelfastFP/events/265558258/),
I think we had 20 minutes. Chose Python so that I could potentially pair with
the person beside me._

Task explained in <https://github.com/holsee/string_date_parser>

To set up a test environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv myvenv &&
. ./myvenv/bin/activate &&
pip install --upgrade pip &&
pip install pytest
```

To run the tests:

pytest main.py
```
